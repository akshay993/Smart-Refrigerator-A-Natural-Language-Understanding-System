# Smart-Refrigerator-A-Natural-Language-Understanding-System
Implemented in Prolog

The Project is done as final project for Computational Linguistics class CSE567.

A natural language understanding system that can interface with a ‘smart’ refrigerator and allow users to text queries or instructions to their fridge.

- Developed a First-Order Logic based Natural Language understanding system that can create exact semantic representations for complex linguistic input and responds appropriately.
- Implemented First-Order Logic with Lambda Calculus.
- Created a vocabulary with lemmas from the different part of speech (like nouns, pronouns, determiners, intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, adjectives etc).
- Grammar has been defined and is used by the parser.
- Modified Shift Reduced Parser is used for parsing the sentence given to the system and
annotating the lexical items with the corresponding syntactic and semantic
representations. Parser output is fed to the model checker.
- A model checker has been created which takes the output of the parser as the input and performs an evaluation on it and responds accordingly to the user.
